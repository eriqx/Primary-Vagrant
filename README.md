Primary Vagrant
=============

_Note:_ Primary Vagrant 3.0 is a major upgrade from earlier versions. If you would like to use an older version please clone [the 2.x branch](https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant/tree/2.x) instead.

Primary Vagrant is intended for WordPress plugin, theme, and core development, as well as general PHP development, and can be used as a replacement for local development stacks such as MAMP, XAMPP, and others.

Although [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) is great (and I still use it for some work), I wanted a few major changes. First, I wanted Apache instead of NGINX and, second, I wanted to use a more comprehensive provisioning tool like Puppet instead of Bash. Using VVV and Puppet as a base, this repository attempts to address these requirements for my own work with a Vagrant configuration that is ready to go for WordPress plugin or theme development.

The repository contains a Vagrant configuration with Puppet modules that will configure the following goodies:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org)
* [PHP](http://php.net) 7.0
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)
* [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org)
* [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
* [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) *for PHP_CodeSniffer*
* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)
* [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org)

## Want to help?

If you find any issues, please don't hesitate to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

### Default domains

* pv - Default menu
* phpmyadmin.pv - phpMyAdmin
* replacedb.pv - Search Replace DB
* core.wordpress.pv - WordPress development (for core dev)
* legacy.wordpress.pv - Last version of WordPress (currently 4.4.x)
* stable.wordpress.pv - Latest WordPress stable (currently 4.5.x)
* trunk.wordpress.pv - WordPress trunk
* webgrind.pv - webgrind

### Install the software

Install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org), and the [VirtualBox extensions](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your environment.

Once Vagrant is installed you'll want three plugins to update your local hosts and update the VirtualBox Guest additions in the Ubuntu install as well as for handling various tasks like backing up your databases when you're done for the day.

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest```

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-ghost```

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers```

### Launch your VM

1. Clone this repo (and it's submodules) onto your local machine:

    ```$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant.git PV```

    *Note: If you download it with the GitHub links you will not get the submodules and you'll wind up with a provisioning error.

1. Change into the new directory with `cd PV`

1. Start the Vagrant environment with `vagrant up`
	- Be patient as the magic happens. This could take a while on the first run as your local machine downloads the required files.
	- Pay attention during execution as an administrator or `su` ***password may be required*** to properly modify the hosts file on your local machine.

### Preconfigured Sites

The following websites come pre-configured in the system:

* [Default menu](http://pv)
* WordPress (last major release) at [http://legacy.wordpress.pv](http://legacy.wordpress.pv)
* WordPress (latest stable release) at [http://stable.wordpress.pv](http://stable.wordpress.pv)
* WordPress Trunk at [http://trunk.wordpress.pv](http://trunk.wordpress.pv)
* WordPress Core Development at [http://core.wordpress.pv](http://core.wordpress.pv)
* Search Replace DB [https://replacedb.pv](https://replacedb.pv)
* phpMyAdmin [http://phpmyadmin.pv](http://phpmyadmin.pv)
* WebGrind [http://webgrind.pv](http://webgrind.pv)
* MailHog [http://pv:8025](http://pv:8025)

*Note: WordPress Core dev is taken from git://develop.git.wordpress.org/. Only the src folder is mapped. You can manually set up a build site if desired.

### Configure Additional Sites

First, create a file called pv-mappings in the user-data directory. This will map any sites you create to the appropriate folder on PV.

Example Mapping:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "user-data/sites/my-site/htdocs", "/var/www/my-site.pv", :owner => "www-data", :mount_options => [ "dmode=775", "fmode=774"]
```

*Note that if you're working on a WordPress plugin or theme I would recommend to simply map it to the three pre-installed WordPress sites. This will make it easy for you to test it on multiple versions of WordPress.

Example:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "user-data/sites/my-awesome-plugin", "/var/www/default-sites/wordpress/content/plugins/my-awesome-plugin", :owner => "www-data", :mount_options => [ "dmode=775", "fmode=774"]
```

Next Edit **user-data/vhosts/``[your-site-domain].pp**. This is where you define virtualhosts and databases. Copy what is below and ask me if you have any questions. Of course these aren't the only configuration options you have either. You can find a [full list of Apache configuration options here](http://github.com/example42/puppet-apache) and a [full list of mysql configuration options here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql).

Example:

```
apache::vhost { 'mysite.pv':
    docroot                         => '/var/www/mysite.pv',
    directory                       => '/var/www/mysite.pv',
    directory_allow_override        => 'All',
    ssl                             => true,
    template                        => '/vagrant/provision/lib/conf/vhost.conf.erb'
}
```

``` mysql
mysql_database { 'mysite.pv':
    ensure  => 'present',
    charset => 'utf8',
    collate => 'utf8_general_ci',
    require => Class['mysql::server'],
}
```

*Note: I've provided a top-level wildcard SSL certificate. No further SSL certificate should be needed.

Finally, and you can do this two ways... If you've created your site as a folder in the Primary Vagrant www folder just add a file callend *pv-hosts* to it that includes the domain name(s) (one per line) for your project. If your site is outside of the Primary Vagrant folder I would recommend creating *www/my-sites/pv-hosts* to hold the domain names. This will make sure you can access your sites by whatever domain names you need.

After the configuration above has been added, simply run `vagrant halt` and then `vagrant up` to trigger the changes and host file updates.

### Changing configuration options

The default installation configuration is found in *provision/manifests/init.pp*. While you could edit this if you like I would, instead, recommend adding any additional configuration to your virtualhosts file such as *user-data/vhosts/custom.pp*

#### Change PHP Versions

Due to the structure of the PHP repositories used changing PHP versions from 7 is not currently supported (but should be soon).

#### Database Access

You can access the database via ssh tunnel into the machine using the *pv* hostname, the username *vagrant*, the password *vagrant* for ssh, and the username *root* without a password for MySQL.

In addition to the *root* MySQL account the account *username* with the password *password* has also been created and has been granted all privileges.

#### Postfix Configuration

Postfix is configured and set to use your host computer as a mail relay. To receive messages you can use the built in [MailHog installation](http://pv:8025) (this will prevent your real SMTP mail server and mailbox from getting too much abuse).

#### WP Test Data
WP Test can be installed via the instructions at (https://github.com/manovotny/wptest). Test data is found in *[Primary Vagrant Folder]/www/default/wordpress/content/wptest* on your host machine.

#### WordPress VIP Development

Looking to work on WordPress VIP sites? I've got a pre-configured site add-on that will take care of it all for you. Check out [Primary Vagrant VIP](https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant-VIP)

#### node.js

The latest stable node.js version is installed, if you want to pre-install packages just add them to your sites virtualhost config such as *user-data/vhosts/nodejs.pp*.

Example:

``` javascript
package { 'ungit':
  provider => npm,
  require  => Class['nodejs']
}
```

### Debugging Code ###

Primary Vagrant comes pre-configured with two awesome tools for helping debug your code. The first is [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) and the second is [PHP_Codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) (which comes complete with the [WordPress coding standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards) already pre-configured). While configuration is dependant on the code editor you use here are some notes that might help you get started with them.

* Xdebug uses VAGRANT_DEBUG as its IDE key
* Many modern tools will let you access both of these tools easily with just a bit of configuration. For example, [here's a great post on using remote debugging in PHPStorm.](http://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2015/07/remote-tools-via-remote-php-interpreters-in-phpstorm-9/)
* [PHPStorm configuration suggestions are in the wiki](https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant/wiki/XDEBUG-Setup-in-PHPStorm).

You can now also turn xdebug on or off completely with the commands `xon` and `xoff`. This should help speed up complex composer or other operations.

For debugging APIs or any other situation where sending a cookie with your request isn't ideal you can turn on auto-listening for xdebug in which case it will try to connect automatically, even without a cookie. To do this simply use the commands `xlon` and `xloff` to enable or disable auto-remote. Note that this is disabled by default.

###Keep your fork up to date with the PV `upstream/master` repo

* Configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant.git`

See: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork

The following commands should bring you up to speed:
* `git checkout <localbranch>`
* `git stash` -- save local changes
* `git pull https://github.com/ChrisWiegman/Primary-Vagrant.git upstream/master`
* `git submodule update --recursive`
* `git stash pop` -- saved local changes are available to be committed
* Use `git merge tool` if you have any conflicts

See: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull

Now, you will be free to PR against Primary Vagrant.
